# FBfocus
A chrome extension to turn Facebook into a messaging app only

## Description

This is a very simple chrome extension that hides the Facebook news feed and the activity feed, so you can still use the messaging part of Facebook without being distracted by anything else.

I might make it better in the future by making it a bit more flexible.
